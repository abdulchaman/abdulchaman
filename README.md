I'm
Front End Developer
The process of design and programming has always been of interest to me, I've been lucky enough to work alongside some talented teams on a number of high profile websites. I have a wide range of skills that include front-end development using technologies (React, ReactJs, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Responsive, UI)
